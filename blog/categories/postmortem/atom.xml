    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>What Happened</h2>

<p>On Friday, July 6, 2012 at 3:42 PM Central Daylight savings, CDT, time I found that I couldn&rsquo;t sign in to Assign It App. In some cases when signing in the site would give an error, a 500 status code. I did some investigating and found it was a site bug, not just me at round 5:12 PM CDT. I worked up a fix and deployed right away with out testing the patch. The patch was deployed around 5:21 PM. This fix did stop the, 500 status codes, but it always said that you didn&rsquo;t have the right email or password. After I found this out I started on another fix. Around 5:32 PM CDT I deployed the second fix. The second patch fix the issue at around 5:36 PM CDT.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>The lesson I took from this is to test your code. Test all of it. Make sure your tests are passing. This will happen in feature releases.</p>
